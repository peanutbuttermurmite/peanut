# peanut
A new distro-agnostic package manager.Coming soon to linux and part of the arch-based, customisable and lightweight Peanut OS.

How it works:

1.A git repository or file hosting service is added to your sources

2.The .peanut files are downloaded

3.Once a .peanut file is verified, a key is assigned to it.

4.Verified packages can be added to your .peanut database.

5.Packages in your database can be installed or uninstalled at any time.

6.Peanut Package Manager keeps a record of all packages installed so you know what they are.

7.Your database and package log are stored at : /opt/peanut/

All commands require root (sudo is recommended)

Framework for creating .peanut files:
Layout your directory in the following way:
```
  peanut \
   install.sh or install.run
   uninstall.sh
   key.txt (created with peanut --verify)
   package-info.txt
   
```
  install.sh or install.run should be an installation script written in Bash
  
  install.sh should follow the framework of installscript-creator-linux for best results
  
  uninstall.sh should contain an uninstallation script written in Bash
  
  key.txt should contain a key to sign the package with, generated by the package manager
  
  package-info.txt should contain the relevant information:
  
  Line 1:Name
  
  Line 2:Description
  
  Line 3:Current Version number
  
  Line 4:Dependencies (space separated)
  
  Once you are all done, install peanut and enter in your terminal:
  peanut --upload https://github.com/github-username/repo-name/peanut
  example: peanut --upload https://github.com/peanutbuttermurmite.com
  OR 
  enter:
  peanut --upload directory-to-peanut
  example: peanut --upload /home/peanut
  
  This will give you a .peanut file which can be installed by the package manager

Commands:
```
peanut install package-name (Install packages from my repository or install a .peanut file)

peanut uninstall package-name (Uninstall all packages)

peanut update --package (Update a package)

peanut update --peanut (Update peanut)

peanut update --all (Update both peanut and all packages)

peanut list (List all packages installed)

peanut uninstall

peanut info (shows help)

```


Subcommands:
```
peanut install --build package-name (Builds dependencies from source instead of using another package manager, support limited at the moment but will grow as time goes on)

peanut list -d (List packages that were downloaded upon installation of peanut)

peanut install --no-verify(Install unverified .peanut files)
```
