Layout your directory in the following way:
  peanut \
   install.sh or install.run
   uninstall.sh
   key.txt
   package-info.txt
 
   
  install.sh or install.run should be an installation script written in Bash
  uninstall.sh should contain an uninstallation script written in Bash
  key.txt should contain a key to sign the package with, generated by the package manager
  package-info.txt should contain the relevant information:
    Line 1:Name
    Line 2:Description
    Line 3:Current Version number
    Line 4:Name of binary file with subcommand --update (must match the Name given in line 1 and the binary file must contain a --update subcommand.
  
  Once you are all done, install peanut and enter in your terminal:
  peanut --upload https://github.com/github-username/repo-name/peanut
  example: peanut --upload https://github.com/peanutbuttermurmite.com
  OR 
  enter:
  peanut --upload directory-to-peanut
  example: peanut --upload /home/peanut
  
  This will give you a .peanut file which can be installed by the package manager
